# BDCC-Oneclick
BDCC-Oneclick is an easy-to-use updater+installer utility for the game Broken Dreams Correctional Center (BDCC)

# Which version is right for me?
If you're on Windows, I highly reccomend the -E version. Otherwise, use the -P version.
There is no real difference between -E and -P other than -E not requiring python to be installed. 

# How to use (by version type)

## '-P' (python) version 
- [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it (if you haven't already)
- Run ``oneclick.py`` in the folder you want to install BDCC (or where you've already installed BDCC)

## '-E' (exe) version 
- Run ``oneclick.exe``

After running oneclick, you can modify ``oneclick.json`` to use BDCC-NSMOD instead, by setting 'nsmod' to true.
You have to rerun oneclick if you modify ``oneclick.json`` for your changes to work.
``oneclick.json`` won't appear until after you first run oneclick.
