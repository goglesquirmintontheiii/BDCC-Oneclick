# BDCC-Oneclick
BDCC-Oneclick is an easy-to-use updater+installer utility for the game Broken Dreams Correctional Center (BDCC)
(For now) there is only a -E and -P version, while I check for bugs and do minor upgrades/fixes.

# Which version is right for me?
If you just want a lightweight and simple updater, use a -P or -E version. Use -P if you want access to configuration.
If you want to use multiple versions and don't mind manually launching versions, use -UP or -UE
If you want to use multiple versions and want to easily launch downloaded versions, use -GUE or -GUP

-E, -UE, and -GUE versions will __only__ run on windows, unless you use Wine. If you use linux, mac, or any other OS that isn't windows, stick to -P, -UP, or -GUP
